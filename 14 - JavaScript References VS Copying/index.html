    // You might think we can just do something like this:

    // team[3] = 'lily'

    // however what happens when we update that array?
    // console.log(team, players)
    // now here is the problem!

    // oh no - we have edited the original array too!

    // Why? It's because that is an array reference, not an array copy. They both point to the same array!

    // So, how do we fix this? We take a copy instead!
    let team2 = players.slice()
    // one day

    // or create a new array and concat the old one in
    let team3 = [].concat(players)

    // or use the new ES6 Spread

    // now when we update it, the original one isn't changed

    // let obj = person

    console.log(obj1)
    // how do we take a copy instead?
   
    // We will hopefully soon see the object ...spread
